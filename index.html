	<h1>Hello, stranger.</h1>
	<p>This page is a public service to everyone eager for personal information about me, since I don't have (at least, properly held) a Facebook or other social media accounts.
	<p>If you're looking for reliable contact options, <a href="/pages/contact">click here</a>.
	<p>Some pictures of my human body and face could be found <a href="/pages/appearance">here</a>.
	<p>Website with more detailed information about my views / beliefs on certain topics, and also technical playground where I test things is located <a href="http://kpxo4dgvglztysi2.onion">here</a>. You need the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">tor browser</a> or a <a href="https://onion.to">clearnet gateway</a> to access it, also expect downtimes because it runs on raspberry pi lol.
	<p>My notable accounts on various websites (incl. e.g. Github) listed <a href="/pages/accounts">here</a>.
	<p>Something that could be named a blog (everything longer than a few paragraphs and written by me) to be found <a href="http://www.kpxo4dgvglztysi2.onion/blog">here</a>.
	<p>That's it. If you have more questions, feel free to <a href="/pages/contact">ask</a> directly. I speak English, Russian and German, also will be happy to have some practice in Spanish. Thx bye.
