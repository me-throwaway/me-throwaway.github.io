	<h2>E-mail</h2>
	<img id="email" src="/img/email.svg"></img>
	<p>Strongly preferable for everything. <a href="/files/gpg_pub.asc">PGP key</a> if reliable encryption is required.
	<h2>Instant messaging / Video / Audio calls etc.</h2>
	<p>It's a difficult topic. The least painful IM options for me to use right now are <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/user/@noperope:matrix.org">Matrix</a> and <a href="https://wire.com/en">Wire</a>; please use those if possible. But of course, if it's matter of life and death, I would accept whatever. Note that emailing about wanted "talking session" in advance considered a great courtesy though.
	<h2>Nicknames</h2>
	<p>The name was given to me at birth, as well as my legal one is Vladymir Zolotov. Use it in all official papers.
	<p>On the other hand, my chosen name I use quite often is Mark Levi. Also you can refer me as Kat Vance, since it was my most used pseudonym during some stage of my life, or just use plain nickname such as fullFeaturedUnicorn. By the way, if you don't mind using something that is not official and care about others, use my chosen name whenever possible.
